Ansible vault is feature which is given by ansible, which will allow us to encrypt our files or variable files.
If we want to hide something like confidential file from others we can use this feature.

# ansible-vault create phpdelpoyment.yml   
this command to create vault,it will ask passwd.
this file noe encrypted we can not view it. If we want to view that, following command we need give.

#ansible-vault edit phpdeployment.yml

#ansible-vault decrypt phpdeployment.yml
to decrypt the file.

If we want to encrypt again, we need to execute the following command
#ansible-vault encrypt phpdeployment.yml

we can not run a playbook in encrypted format, if we want to run the playbook in encryped format
#ansible-playbook phpdepolyment --ask-vault-pass
passwd:......
confirm passwd: .......

now we can that play book.
